### Description
**Objective:** The goal of this challenge is to get your feet wet on data manipulation using Arrow vectors while also enforcing good development habits.

**Challenge:** Receive the CSV file path as a program argument, read from a csv file and populate VectorSchemaRoot with the values from the csv (all the vectors can be StringVectors, since CSV does not specify column types). Then create a new csv which should be equal to the first one.

Sample CSV file: [https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/csv/mlb_players.csv](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/csv/mlb_players.csv)

___
**You will practice:**
* Working with CSV files
* Working with arrow vectors
* Creating unit tests
* Searching the web for answers
* Planning the development ahead
* Git

**This time we will not provide you with a repository to fork from. Please create your own maven project and your own repo on GitHub.**

**REMEMBER TO NOT COMMIT THINGS ON MASTER: Create pull requests instead, so we can review it.**

**ETA: 8h**
