This team is currently working on the Billing service for DCS.<br/>
The main responsibilities for this service are: (1) tracking all billable platform usage and (2) carrying out day-to-day billing  operations (e.g., credit load, credit deduction, generate/send invoices, notify customers that they're running out of credits etc).

As a DCS team, our skillset is mainly comprised of: (1) distributed/cloud computing and microservices, (2) enterprise application development using Java, (3) gRPC, (4) Kubernetes and (5) Google Cloud.

DCS is, in essence, a gRPC-based k8s service mesh running on GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine).
